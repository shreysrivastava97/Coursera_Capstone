# Coursera_Capstone
This is my first GitHub repository. It contains my first Data Science Project which is the Capstone Project for the professional certification offered by IBM on Coursera.
Since Github does not render folium maps natively, the maps along with the full notebook can be viewed on: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shreysrivastava97/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/capstone_notebook.ipynb
